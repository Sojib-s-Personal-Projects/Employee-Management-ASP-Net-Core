 A web application to manage employees in an organization. The 
admin can scan a unique bar code against a particular employee and 
store it in the database. Only after scanning an employee's barcode 
can the admin insert or update their salary in the database. A report 
can also be generated as a CSV or Excel sheet with the information of 
those employees whose barcode and salary records are inserted in 
the database. There are also options to filter the report by individual 
column values.
I have used the MySQL server to store and retrieve all the information. 
As part of this project, I have also implemented the Entity Framework, 
Unit of Work pattern, and Repository Pattern.
